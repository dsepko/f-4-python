# Motivation
Stumbled upon the F-4 instruction set as I was looking around to see what the minimum required number of instructions to satisfy Turing-completeness was. Of course, OISC exists, but it's really just a mixture of elementary instructions bundled into one. 
# f-4-python
A simple interpreter for the F-4 MISC processor whose instruction set is described here: http://www.dakeng.com/misc.htm.

In the above example image, a very crude check is done to see if the instructions are working as expected. Will need to make this look better, and add the ability to load files.

# Next steps
Nice interface, implement more complex instructions.
